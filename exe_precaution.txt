From developer: Debu Patra

The executable file is created using the pyinstaller library. I recommend to not open this .exe file directly in the local system.
It may not open and also give errors like UNKNOWN SOURCE or Virus and Threat protection errors. 
To use this application atleast now please checkout the given link to avoid this issue.

Best wishes to GATE Aspirants and all users of this application.
