# GUI_Calculator

I wish good luck to all the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) exam aspirants.
It is adviced to all the GATE aspirants that they practice any type of calculation work on GATE calculator.
So, that they can get used to with the format of that virtual calculator.
Since, this calculator is only available as an mobile application, students don't get an actual experience of using it on a computer
as they will do in the examination.
So, in this project I created a GUI calculator application that is similar to the GATE virtual Calculator.
